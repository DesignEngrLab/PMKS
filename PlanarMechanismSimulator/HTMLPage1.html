    <p>
        to do</p>
    <ul>
        <li>for ground P and RP are a bit different - the ground position changes!<ul>
            <li>also the slide reference is meaningless - err - maybe not for RP</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>lengths for link - are these based on points or joints</li>
        <li>how does this affect nondyadic optimization</li>
        <li>link angle is &quot;at the mercy&quot; of joint positions but when it&#39;s the input crank - 
            how to change</li>
        <li>oh, input crank - for dyadic/nondyadic distinction, need to take into account 
            all the joints on an input link that is binary/ternary etc.</li>
        <li>that important - a single joint is an input but it affects the connected links<ul>
            <li>and if one of those links is not ground? (oh boy, that&#39;s tough but rare)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
