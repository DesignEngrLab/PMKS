    <p>
        to do</p>
    <ul>
        <li>still trying to handle SlideAngle and ortho distance for P and RP</li>
        <li>in all the known and unknown business how to deal with slides?</li>
        <li>and what&#39;s up with gears!?<ul>
            <li>idea to use SlideAngle for racks</li>
            <li>how to determine round gear central pivots? is it even necessary?</li>
            <li>the angle updates between gears is tough since joint-point doesn&#39;t move&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>how to find and set new SlideAngle</li>
        <li>R-P-R case is more complicated than though</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>for ground P and RP are a bit different - the ground position changes!<ul>
            <li>also the slide reference is meaningless - err - maybe not for RP</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>lengths for link - are these based on points or joints</li>
        <li>how does this affect nondyadic optimization</li>
        <li>link angle is &quot;at the mercy&quot; of joint positions but when it&#39;s the input crank - 
            how to change</li>
        <li>oh, input crank - for dyadic/nondyadic distinction, need to take into account 
            all the joints on an input link that is binary/ternary etc.</li>
        <li>that&#39;s important - a single joint is an input but it affects the connected links<ul>
            <li>and if one of those links is not ground? (oh boy, that&#39;s tough but rare)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
