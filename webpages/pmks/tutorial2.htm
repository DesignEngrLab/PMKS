<h1>Creating a Crank-&amp;-Slider Mechanism: Tutorial 2</h1>

  <p>This tutorial will define a very popular mechanism referred to as a
  crank-slider. It is simply done by changing one of the revolute (R) joints
  from the four-bar to a prismatic slider (P). </p>
  <p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;'>1.<span

  Open the four-bar you created in the first tutorial by clicking the open 
  button in the upper left. If you didn't save one, you can start with this
  <a href="http://people.oregonstate.edu/~campmatt/pmks/pmks.html?mech=ground input R 0 0 0 ffft|input coupler R 0 50 0 ffff|coupler output R 115 80 0 ffff|output ground R 85 0 0 ffff|coupler R 50 80 0 ffff|" target="_blank">

  to get to the simulator.</a></p>
  <p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;'>2.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Set
  the last joint from the “R” joint to a “P” joint. This is the link that is connected
  to ground – not the tracer point made in step 6 of the first tutorial. You
  should see something like this:<p class="auto-style1">
 <img src="images/crank-slider.png"></br>
  <em>Figure 
  1: Example Crank-Slider.</em></p>
<p>Note:
  that the “P” joint requires an angle to be provide for it to be properly
  specified. Indicate in the Angle column a value in degrees. Typically values
  can range from -90° to +90°.</p>
  <p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;'>4.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
  addition to specifying the angle and position in the table, one may also
  click and drag the icon. Click on the purple arrows to move the joint in x
  &amp; y or click on pink arrows to rotate the slide. Note: you are not having
  to catch the moving link! You manipulate the unfilled icon that appears at
  the initial location.</p>
  <p class="auto-style1" ><em><img src="images/moveIcon.png" ></br>Figure
  2: A close-up of the icons that can be clicked and dragged with the mouse.
  Don’t try to catch <br>
  the moving filled-in joints – you move the hollow icons that indicate the
  joints position at t = 0.</em><o:p></o:p><em></i></em></p>
  <p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;'>5.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
  the far left of the table, you can change the input or the driving joint in
  the mechanism to any joint connected to ground. This applies to “P” joints as
  well. Click the radio-button in the row for your “P” joint. What happened?
  Hopefully, the mechanism is moving but it might be moving at a different
  speed. Note how the text above the speed box has changed from rpm to units/sec.
  Now the input is to move the slider at the designated velocity. The “units”
  can be thought of as either inches, or mm.</p>
  <p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;'>6.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Set
  that link back to an “R” joint to return to a four-bar. Now, let us set one
  of the non-grounded joints to a “P” joint. This essentially creates an
  inversion of a crank-slider. Don’t forget to specify an angle. You might have
  a new mechanism that looks something like one of these:</p>
  <p class="auto-style1" ><em><img src="images/three-example-rrpr.png"><br>Figure
  3: Three example four-bar mechanisms with an intermediate joint as a
  prismatic slider (“P” joint).</em></p>
  <p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;'>7.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Note
  how the slider is one link and the other link connects to the fixed block.
  This is not arbitrary. It depends on the order of the link-names as provided
  in the “Links” column. Try switching the order. For example change:</p>
  <div class="auto-style1">
  <img src="images/porder1.png" class="auto-style6" ><span class="auto-style4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	  <img src="images/porder2.png" class="auto-style7" ></span> </div>
  <p></p>
  <p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;' class="auto-style8">7.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
  you can try replacing other R joints with P joints, but beware of the
  following constraints:</p>
  <p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;' class="auto-style8">a.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
  simulation will not be able to start if any P joints are at the same angle.
  This is because at this starting point there is an additional degree-of-freedom
  that cannot be handled. </p>
  <p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;' class="auto-style8">b.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
  cannot have a 4-bar with only one “R” joint as the rotation of this single “R”
  will need to be accommodated by some counter-rotation in another R joint.
  PMKS will indicate this as a zero DOF mechanism.</p>
  <p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;' class="auto-style8">c.<span
  style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
  cannot make a mechanism consisting of four P joints. This will have 2 degrees
  of freedom, but you can make a mechanism with 3 links and 3 joints.</p>
