    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        unknwon angles - can&#39;t just handle with additional reference joints because 
        these jonts can&#39;t be reasoned with in big loop</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px">
        seems like it&#39;ll happen a lot for gears too</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <strong>[done] </strong>&nbsp;separating out topology changes from parameters</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px">
        <strong>[done] </strong>inferring extra gear links and joints and sliding only links to have new 
        reference from other code</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        <strong>[done] </strong>generality of find functions - had to put slide joints before pivots in big 
        list, but is this enough?</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px">
        <strong>[done] </strong>should we store the half-known slide joints on a separate list</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        some of the R-P combos seem to have diametric jumps - still a bug? or just need 
        finer time-step</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        it seems there will be G-R-? and G-P-? and G-RP-? dyads to solve.</p>
